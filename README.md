# ![Fireline](https://github.com/EricKirschenmann/Fireline/blob/master/assets/ic_launcher-web.png) Fireline Application
Fireline is a publicly available utility that displays current events that the Ventura County Emergency Response System has responded to.

This is my Android Application which relies on the freely available JSON data and parses it into user readable information and details.

### Currently for my educational purposes and practice only, I am making no money on this application and I am not responsible for the data provided by Ventura County, to which access can be revoked at their discretion.
